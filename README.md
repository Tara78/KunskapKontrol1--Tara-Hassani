<!-- 1-Byt ut minst ett foto -->
Fist by writing querSelector I choose which img I wanna change. puting all information about the location of the img in the pranteses. It has a class then putting (.) bofore art3 to show that it has a class. 

Then attribute it by use setAttribute method and gives an specefic value and change the value which it is alreday exists. 
Addred the new img after 'src'. 



<!-- 2-Ändra bakgrundsfärg på minst ett element -->
Fist made a new variable and gave some name to the new variable, and wrote address, location on the HTML or on the document.  

Second make console.log to see the result and make sure that you choose a right option which want to change. Last stage is about CSS. First of all, I rewrote the variable which I made, then. style and after that choose the backgrounds to able to change the color, then added (=) and wrote on the string ('') which color want to have and finished the line by putting semicolon (;). 


Keydown event! 
I used addEventListener method.  

And put the if condition to change the backgroundColor. For example, by pressing the(r)or(R) backgroundColor change to Red colour.  


<!-- 3-Ändra text på minst ett element -->
Fist made a new variable and gave some name to my variable, and wrote address or location in the HTML or in the document.  

Second make console.log to see the result. Then I changed the text to a new text. I used inner Text for the change, which I could use inner HTML. Both have a same result.  

<!-- 4-Ändra färg på minst en knapp --> 

First made a new variable and gave a new name to the variable. Wrote the address from HTML (the location in HTML). Put (.)after string in the address to show that refer to an Article in the HTML, for example using # for(id) and ('') for body or element.  

last stage, is refer to the style or CSS. Started by writing (. style) and then choose which change we want to do.  backgrounds, font Size .... 


<!-- 5-Ta bort minst 1 element (Måste läggas till igen när man trycker på återställningsknappen) -->

Select Nav element and call it remove Key. Select the header-navigation and named as parent. And then select all items in navigation and called element.  
Then adding Event listener event will be (click) to the first item. I used function for this event to remove the child.  For this event, I select the parent ad then use of remove child function. Then check on the browser. By the click on the first item, u can see the item has gone. I could keep going the same way by using array and selec the index number for example [0]. This way is fou removing one item. By useing for-loop consept i could use to remove all three items. Useing the same method (select the parent and remove the child). 

The last method is useing innerHTML with empty sting (''). First we have to write parent. Then inneHTML= empty sting and finish the line by semicolon(;). 
InnerHTML method can remove all item by one time click. 


In general " for removing any item from the DOM , first we have to select the parent and the removeChild. 

I create a button by using createElement and the used appendChild to show the button and then used textContent .  

Using conditionalStatement (if, else) statment for being visable menu items. Means that the menu items would be viable by clicking the button once and with the next click they are disappearing.


<!-- 6-Lägg till en lista var som helst i DOMen (måste tas bort med resetknappen)
   a.Listan ska innehålla flera li element
   b.Varje li element ska ha en synlig border. (Valfritt utseende)  -->

  First create a ul and named  newList. Then create a className and textContent.  Later style it, like, fontSize and fonWight. And pint them by (console.log) to see the result.  

Second made a li, and the same process and ul.  

I create a button by using createElement and the used appendChild to show the button and then used textContent .  

Using conditionalStatement (if, else) statment for being visable  ul. Means that the ul would be viable by clicking the button once and with the next click the ul disappear.
